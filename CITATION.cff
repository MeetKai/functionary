abstract: "Functionary is a language model that can interpret and execute functions/plugins. 
The model determines when to execute functions, whether in parallel or serially, and can 
understand their outputs. It only triggers functions as needed. Function definitions are given 
as JSON Schema Objects, similar to OpenAI GPT function calls."
